The repository to my first ever page using web technologies for a university course.

"main_page" refers to the folder that contaings the main styling of the page.

"contact_form" refers to the folder that -through a button link- acts as a contact form and stores some user info in a database through myAdminPHP.

All code was written on CodePen.
